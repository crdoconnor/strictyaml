title: Why shouldn't I just use Python code for configuration?
---

It is relatively common for many applications to avoid the use of a different
markup language for configuration and simply allow configuration to be
done using code. One famous and unapologetic example of this is
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings), which
requires all configuration to be in a "settings.py" or similar file.

This seems like a great idea from the outset - Python is more flexible
than any configuration language, so, for instance, if you wanted to
use a list comprehension or read a file or call an API to fill a value,
you can.

However, with this flexibility comes many traps and unsightly
pitfalls. The Django pitfalls in particular are
[cogently summed up by Ned Bachelder on
his blog](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201112/duplicitous_django_settings.html) -
pitfalls which have been the cause of countless bugs over the
years.

The language expressiveness trade off applies at every level in code

A good way of refactoring, in fact, is to take a large chunk of Turing-complete Python code that *can* be transformed directly into StrictYAML with no loss in expressiveness and and to transform it - for example, a list of translation strings, countries or parameters.

It also makes it easier to have the markup generated by another program or a templating language. While you 
technically *can* do this with Turing-complete code, it will often lead to a debugging nightmare - [just ask C++ programmers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/622659/what-are-the-good-and-bad-points-of-c-templates>)!
