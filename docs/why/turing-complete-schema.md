title: Why does StrictYAML make you define a schema in Python - a turing complete language?
---

StrictYAML defines schemas in Python (i.e. turing complete) code. For example:

```python
Map({"name": Str(), "email": Str()})
```

Instead of:

```yaml
type:       map
mapping:
"name":
    type:      str
    required:  yes
"email":
    type:      str
    required:  yes
```
      
There are some trade offs here:

Schema definition in a non-turing complete language like YAML makes
the schema programming language independent and gives it more
potential for being read and understood by non-programmers.

However, schema definition in a non-turing complete language also
restricts and makes certain use cases impossible or awkward.

Some use cases I came across included:

- Being able to import pycountry's country list and restrict "country: " to valid country names.

- Being able to implement a schema that validated date/time scalar values against the specific date/time parser I wanted.

- Being able to revalidate sections of the document on a 'second pass' that used new data - e.g. a list in one part of the document is restricted to items which come from another part.
