### 1.0.5

* BUGFIX : Fixed Python 2 bug introduced when fixing #72.
* BUG: issue #72.  Now __setitem__ uses schema.

Before this commit, schemas could be violated when assigning to
Map/Sequence members.  Now, modifications to the data must fit the
data's schema.

Furthermore, if the node on which __setitem__ is called has a compound
schema, the selected validator within the compound schema may change
correctly.


### 1.0.4

* FEATURE : Include tests / stories in package.
* BUG: issue #72.  Now __setitem__ uses schema.

Before this commit, schemas could be violated when assigning to
Map/Sequence members.  Now, modifications to the data must fit the
data's schema.

* FEATURE : Raise exception if more than one sequence validators are combined.


### 1.0.1
